# Steps for getting defintions or synonyms

1. Ask user to choose between dictionary or synonym

    -> Format the word to account for spaces
        -> Replace whitespaces by either "+" or "%20"

=> Link format: 
    -> Dictionary: https://dictionary.com/browse/{word}
    -> Synonym: https://thesaurus.com/browse/{word}

=> Element attributes: (<tag>, class="")
    -> Dictionary: ("div", "e1fc5zsj0")
        <div class="e1fc5zsj0"></div>

    -> Synonym: ("div", "e15rdun50")
        <div class="e15rdun50"></div>
