# Steps for the hangman game

- Get the user input

- Run a conditional that checks the following:
    -> If user guess is correct: write the letter in the correct position
    -> If user guess is incorrect: tell the user the guess is incorrect.

- In either case: remove the guessed letter from the options list

- After each guess, list the entire option list

- Run the above until the entire word is guessed correctly
